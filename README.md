<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

Throughout 2023, K. Sophie Will and Eric S. Peterson of the Utah Investigative Journalism Project acquired records of nearly a quarter of a million charges filed in Utah State Courts relating to domestic violence covering Dec. 1, 2013 to Nov. 30, 2023. From Sophie's data analysis, Sophie and Eric wrote a series on the state of domestic violence in Utah courts, released in early 2024 by the Salt Lake Tribune, supported by funding from the Alicia Patterson Foundation and the Fund for Investigative Journalism. 

In this repo you will find the clean data for both Justice and District courts, as well as a data memo with our findings. Please don't hesitate to reach out to Sophie with any questions, her contact information can be found below.

## Guide to this Project

- [ ] Data
  - [ ] District Master (in .xlsx and .csv) is the raw and cleaned data of every charge relating to domestic violence filed in District Courts in the time frame.
  - [ ] Justice Master (in .xlsx and .csv) is the raw and cleaned data of every charge relating to domestic violence filed in Justice Courts in the time frame.
    - NOTE: The Justice Master .csv file had to be zipped due to its size.
- [ ] Data Analysis
  - [ ] UIJP Data Memo is a .pdf of the case analysis done on the raw data, grouped by cases, from both courts. It includes numbers on the total charges and cases, the proportion of cases to the population, case severity, whether the case was related to domestic violence at its disposition, filing year, sentencing year, verdict, per court, dismissals per court, the severity of those dismissed and dismissals by urban and rural areas.
  - [ ] District Data Analysis and Justice Data Analysis are Excel workbooks containing the tables in the data memo for ease of use.
  - NOTE: This analysis was done by grouping charges into their cases, so when describing these findings, use the wording "__ number of cases include at least one charge that __."
